# Algebra-Calculator
Can only solve basic equations for now.

# How To Use
Input an algebraic equation eg: 2x+5=15

# Limitations
It is unable to compute more complex equations like with parenthesis or higher degrees as of yet.
Feel free to test its limitations to your liking.

# Future Implementation
1. Support for more complex equations and higher degree variables.
2. Decimal to fraction and vice versa.
3. Factoring.
