# Algebra-Calculator
Can only solve basic equations for now.

# How To Use
1. Input an algebraic equation (if its an expression, it will only simplify)
   Ex: 2x+5=15
3. Input the variable you are trying to find. 


# Limitations
It is unable to compute more complex equations like with parenthesis or higher degrees as of yet.
Feel free to test its limitations to your liking.

# Future Implementation
1. Support for more complex equations and higher degree variables.
2. Decimal to fraction and vice versa.
3. Factoring.
